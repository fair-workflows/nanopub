# Retracting a nanopublication
A nanopublication is persistent, you can never edit nor delete it. You can however retract a nanopublication. This is done by publishing a new nanopublication that states that you retract the original publication. You can use `NanopubClient.retract()`:
```python
from nanopub import NanopubConfig, NanopubRetract

np_config = NanopubConfig(profile=load_profile(), use_test_server=True)

np = NanopubRetract(
	'http://purl.org/np/RAfk_zBYDerxd6ipfv8fAcQHEzgZcVylMTEkiLlMzsgwQ',
    np_config,
)
np.publish()
```
View the full retraction nanopublication [here](http://purl.org/np/RAv75Xhhz5jv--Nnu9RDqIGy2xHr74REGC4vtOSxrwX4c).

The assertion states that the researcher (denoted by the ORCID iD from your profile) retracts the provided nanopublication:
```turtle
@prefix npx: <http://purl.org/nanopub/x/> .
@prefix sub: <http://purl.org/np/RAv75Xhhz5jv--Nnu9RDqIGy2xHr74REGC4vtOSxrwX4c#> .

sub:assertion {
    <https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000> npx:retracts <http://purl.org/np/RAfk_zBYDerxd6ipfv8fAcQHEzgZcVylMTEkiLlMzsgwQ> .
}
```
By default nanopublications that have a valid retraction do not show up in search results. A valid retraction is a retraction that is signed with the same public key as the nanopublication that it retracts.

## Retracting a nanopublication that is not yours
By default we do not retract nanopublications that are not yours (i.e. signed with another public key). If you try to do this it will trigger an AssertionError.

We can use `force=True` to override this behavior:
```python
np = NanopubRetract(
	'http://purl.org/np/RAfk_zBYDerxd6ipfv8fAcQHEzgZcVylMTEkiLlMzsgwQ',
    np_config,
    force=True
)
```

## Find retractions of a given nanopublication
You can find out whether a given publication is retracted and what the nanopublications are that retract it using `NanopubClient.find_retractions_of`:
```python
from nanopub import NanopubClient
client = NanopubClient(use_test_server=True)
# This URI has 1 retraction:
client.find_retractions_of('http://purl.org/np/RAirauh-vy5f7UJEMTm08C5bh5pnWD-abb-qk3fPYWCzc')
['http://purl.org/np/RADjlGIB8Vqt7NbG1kqzw-4aIV_k7nyIRirMhPKEYVSlc']
# This URI has no retractions
client.find_retractions_of('http://purl.org/np/RAeMfoa6I05zoUmK6sRypCIy3wIpTgS8gkum7vdfOamn8')
[]
```
